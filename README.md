# Hi.
my name is `Jaekwang Shin`, and my nickname is `jaepang`.   
I'm working ~rocked~ on Republic of Korea Army currently, but going to quit on December.   
My dream is to become positive influencer through my `code`.   
I'm currently learning `CS`, `frontend` and have interest in `ML` or `full stack`.
